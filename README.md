GLM-Regularized low-rank factorization for extracting functional response from Swept-3D Functional UltraSound

This package reproduces the results of the paper titled "GLM-Regularized Low-Rank Factorization for Extracting Functional Response from Swept-3D Functional Ultrasound" by Aybüke Erol, Bastian Generowicz, Pieter Kruizinga and Borbála Hunyadi (currently under review).

All codes are written in MATLAB. CVX should be installed (http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/install.html) for using this repository.
